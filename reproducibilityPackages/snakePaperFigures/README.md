# Full-replication of our previous findings on the aerodynamics of the flying-snake

This folder contains the figures (saved in a pdf format) and a Jupyter-Notebook.

The purpose of the Notebook is to display the figures sequentially and the caption for each one.

Each figure can be re-generated very easily is requested.

Figures that display the instantaneous force coefficients come with a log file in which, the time-averaged values are provided.
