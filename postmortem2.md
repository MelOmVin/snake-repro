**Postmortem**. 
Even the best open-source research code can have unexpected attributes that only the original authors know in depth. 
We still don't understand _why_ IBAMR requires interior body points to be constrained, despite insistent reading of the literature. 
One issue that affects our community is that we don't expect authors to provide in their papers all the details, nor do we require papers to be accompanied by code and data. 
We learned from this experience that using an open research code and getting correct results with it could involve a long investigative period, potentially requiring communication with the original authors and many failed attempts. 
If the code is not documented and the original authors not responsive to questions, then building your own code from scratch could be more sensible!
