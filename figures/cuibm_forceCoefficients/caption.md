Instantaneous force coefficients on the snake's section at (a) Reynolds number 1000 and angle 35 degrees and (b) Reynolds number 2000 and angle 30 degrees.
(c) Instantaneous force coefficients at Reynolds number 2000 and angle-of-attack 35 degrees running the same version of cuIBM (adapted to CUSP-0.4.0) than the one used for our previous study.
(d) Drop of the mean force coefficients observed over the end of the simulation using two versions of cuIBM ("current" and "old") with different CUSP versions (0.4.0 and 0.5.1).
