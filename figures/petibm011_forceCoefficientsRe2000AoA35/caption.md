Instantaneous force coefficients for the snake's section with angle-of-attack 35 degrees and Reynolds number 2000.
The top plot compares the PetIBM results with those reported in our previous study.
The bottom plot shows results with the immersed-boundary being rotated around the reference origin or  around its center of mass (the latter is slightly shifted compared to our previous study).
