Instantaneous force coefficients on the snake's section with angle-of-attack 30 degrees (top) and 35 degrees (bottom) at Reynolds number 2000.
We compare the IcoFOAM results with the cuIBM results from our previous study.
We created a 3.4 million cells (mostly hexahedra) with SnappyHexMesh, one of the OpenFOAM mesh utilities.
