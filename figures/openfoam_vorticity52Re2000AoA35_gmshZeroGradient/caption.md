Vorticity field after 52 time-units of flow-simulation with IcoFOAM for a snake's section with angle-of-attack 35 degrees and Reynolds number 2000.
We created a triangular mesh (about 700k triangles) with the free software GMSH.
The box insert at the bottom-right shows a zoom-in to the portion of the mesh with spurious vorticity (seen bottom-center of the main plot).
