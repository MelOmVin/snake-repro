Time-averaged drag (top) and lift (bottom) coefficients as function of the snake's angle-of-attack and for Reynolds numbers 1000 and 2000 using the same Eulerian mesh as in our past cuIBM simulations.
We show PetIBM results obtained when the immersed-boundary is rotated around: (1) its center of mass (green and orange symbols) and (2) the reference origin (solo red marker).
