Our research group prides itself for having adopted Reproducible Research practices. 
Barba made a public pledge titled *"Reproducibility PI Manifesto"* ^(1) (PI: Principal Investigator), which at the core is a promise to make all research materials and methods open access and discoverable: releasing code, data and analysis/visualization scripts.

In 2014, we published a study on Physics of Fluids titled *"Lift and wakes of flying snakes."* ^(2) 
It is a study that uses our in-house code for solving the equations of fluid motion in two dimensions (2D), with a solution approach called the “immersed boundary method.” 
The key of such a method for solving the equations is that it exchanges complexity in the mesh generation step for complexity in the application of boundary conditions. 
It makes it possible to use a simple discretization mesh (structured Cartesian), but at the cost of an elaborate process that interpolates values of fluid velocity at the boundary points to ensure the no-slip boundary condition (that fluid sticks to a wall). 
The main finding of our study on wakes of flying snakes was that the 2D section with anatomically correct geometry for the snake’s body experiences lift enhancement at a given angle of attack.
A previous experimental study had already shown that the lift coefficient of a snake cross section in a wind tunnel gets an extra oomph of lift at 35 degrees angle-of-attack. 
Our simulations showed the same feature in the plot of lift coefficient.^(3) 
Many detailed observations of the wake (visualized from the fluid-flow solution in terms of the vorticity field in space and time) allowed us to give an explanation of the mechanism providing extra lift.

When a computational research group produces this kind of study with an in-house code, it can take one, two or even three years to write a full research software from scratch, and complete verification and validation. 
Often, one gets the question: why not use a commercial CFD package? (CFD: computational fluid dynamics.) 
Why not use another research group’s open-source code? 
Doesn't it take much longer to write yet another CFD solver than to use existing code? 
Beyond reasons that have to do with inventing new methods, it’s a good question. 
To explore using an existing CFD solver for future research, we decided to first complete a full replication of our previous results with these alternatives. 
Our commitment to open-source software for research is unwavering, which rules out commercial packages. 
Perhaps the most well known open-source fluid-flow software is OpenFOAM, so we set out to replicate our published results with this code. 
A more specialist open-source code is IBAMR, a project born at New York University that has continued development for a decade. 
And finally, our own group developed a new code, implementing the same solution method we had before, but providing parallel computing via the renowned PETSc library. 
We embarked on a full replication study of our previous work, using three new fluid-flow codes.

This is the story of what happened next: three years of dedicated work that encountered a dozen ways that things can go wrong, conquered one after another, to arrive finally at (approximately) the same findings and a whole new understanding of what it means to do “reproducible research” in computational fluid dynamics.
